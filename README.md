# 🤚 Hand Gesture Recognition Model

📌 What the Project Is

This project is a **Hand Gesture Recognition Model** that accurately identifies and classifies different hand gestures from image or video data. It enables intuitive **human-computer interaction** and **gesture-based control systems**, using computer vision and deep learning techniques.


💡 Why It Exists

In modern user interfaces, natural interaction is key. Traditional input devices like keyboards and mice limit how we interact with machines. This project aims to:
• Allow gesture-based input systems for enhanced user experience
• Assist in creating touchless systems (important for hygiene in public spaces)
• Enable control in AR/VR environments and IoT devices
• Support accessibility tools for individuals with disabilities


🛠️ How to Use It

1. **Input**: The system takes either static images or real-time video feed from your webcam.
2. **Output**: The predicted gesture label (e.g., "Thumbs Up", "Victory", "Stop").
3. **UI**: Real-time camera feed with overlaid prediction text.

Use Cases:
• Smart home control via hand gestures
• Virtual presentations or games
• Touchless kiosks
